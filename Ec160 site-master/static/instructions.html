    <h1>The Traffic Simulation</h1>
    
    <p>
        Welcome to the Traffic Simulation. In the following experiment you will be in control of one car on the track which you can control as your like. There are four controls: 
        <ul>
            <li>w - accelerate</li>
            <li>s - brake</li>
            <li>a - change lanes up</li>
            <li>d - change lanes down</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p> 
        We will play 1 practice round to familiarize you with the controls, and 12 rounds of actual simulations. Each round lasts for 2 minutes. At the beginning of each round, you will be randomly ordered. The race track is circular. This means if a car goes off the right end of the race it will reappear on the left end of the race track. You will be compensated based on how you drive. Each time you crash you will lose $0.10 and for every pixel you cover on the screen you will be paid $0.00004. Your current earnings for the round are displayed below the racetrack, and will be recorded at the end of each round.
